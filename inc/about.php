		Hi, my name is Mario Toscano.<br> I live in Puntalazzo (Ct) with my mom, my  dad and my brother. <br>I have a dog and a cat as well.
		<br>I love writing blogs about what I do during my day and what i felt and for that I write blogs.
		<br>Yes, my life is strange so I have to enterainment myself. <br>When i was child I used to have a little personal diary where i chronicled my boring day and my new friends. <br>In this little diary there are some adventure that I've lived like when I broke my leg while riding a bike. <br>I was riding my bike when I lost the control and I fell down. <br>Still I remember myself looking at the bumb in the middle of my lenght!
		<br>Now that I am older, I'd like to share my day with you. <br>So I decided to open this blog and use it like a diary. <br>I had much problem for this blog, because I show what I think about certain people, but it is only my personal opinion, not the absoluty truth! <br>I have also problem with my baker because i wrote that for me it had to keep more open than now. 
		<br>I work for a phone company in a call center and when I was at home i dedicate a few of my time writing articles for my blogs.<br>And for this blogs I was payed also! 
		<br>And it is my wonderful presentetion! Now I fill the remaing space with ads for earn more money! 
		<br>Follow me also on Twitter and Facebook!
		<br>See Yaa!
